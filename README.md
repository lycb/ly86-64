# LY86-64

[**LY86-64**](https://www.ly86-64.com/home) ("lee 86-64") is a browser-based simulator developed to help students visualize the Y86-64 machine. Although inspired by other Y86-64 simulators, the LY86-64 was designed to provide a visualization of the control logic and signals, specifically stalling and bubbling. This is a senior thesis project built by Jenny Ly from Appalachian State University.
